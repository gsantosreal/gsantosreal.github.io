            <p class="para">
                My name is Gael Camil Santos Rodriguez. 
                I am a sophomore computer science major and Spanish minor from New York by way of the Dominican Republic. 
                My primary passions are for computer science, language learning, and activism.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                I first found passion in computer science in 5th grade, through SCRATCH and also my love for video games.
                I have since taken computer science classes at every opportunity, and I am majoring in it now in college.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                I've been interested in learning languages ever since I could.
                Since I am Hispanic, Spanish has always been a language of interest for me. 
                I've dabbled a few languages over the years, such as Chinese, French, and even a bit of Swahili. 
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                Activism has always been an interest of mine due to my upbringing.
                Though I was raised in the Bronx, full of minority cultures and social awareness,
                I moved to suburban New York before 10th grade, which was a complete reversal from what I was used to.
                I had experienced systemic discrimination with my own five senses, and I can't stand for it.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                P.S.: As of right now, I have no intention of cutting my hair. <br>
                (Hopefully it stays that way!)
